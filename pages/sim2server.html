<h4 class="mb-3 fw-bold"><br>
	You like the games such as the ones listed on the <a href="/">main page</a>? Then the Sim2Server might be a good place for you.
</h4>

<p class="mb-3 fw-bold">
    Of course you can also just chill on that server (though you'd likely have more fun there if you like one or more of the games).
</p>

<p>
    You can talk about the games, or also learn more about it or share your knowledge.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
    It doesn't matter how well you're experienced with the games, you can even be a newcomer to the games, or a master that can help out by questions or just be someone, that enjoys playing the games.
</p>

<p class="mb-3">
    There are also some projects related about the games, such as <a href="https://sim2team.github.io/Sim2Editor/">Sim2Editor</a>, which is a web browser save editor for Currently: The Sims 2 (Game Boy Advance & Nintendo DS), or also straight researches about the Savefiles with <a href="https://github.com/Sim2Team/Sim2Research">Sim2Research</a>. There is also <a href="https://github.com/Sim2Team/Optimum-Alfred-Bot">Optimum Alfred</a>, a discord bot for Sim2Server which is still kinda a work in progress that should make the stay on that server more nicely.
</p>

<p>
    You can find more information about the Server below.
